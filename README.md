# Digital Education Website

In this project I've used bootstrap as CSS framwork, & created with react. [Click here to see Live Website](https://digital-education.netlify.app/).

## Uses of this Website

In the website you can see:

### `5 Menu`

Each menu has their own details except Contact menu. If you click Contact menu you will get 404 Not Found

### `Home Menu`

In home you will get a header section, then some details about course (mainly there have 4 course details) & in the bottom a footer section.

### `Courses Menu`

In Courses you will get a header section, then all course details & in the bottom a footer section.

### `Student Menu`

**Note: In this page you will see  `Sign In` text, but you canâ€™t find any `Sign In` form because I didn't created ye!**
